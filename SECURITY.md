## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please DO NOT open public GitHub issues or discussions for suspected security vulnerabilities.** Public disclosure before a fix is available puts users and production services at risk.

### Private Reporting Channels

1. **GitHub Security Advisory (Preferred):**
   Navigate to the [Security page](https://github.com/bhubbard/unified-audit-rs/security/advisories) on GitHub and select **"Report a vulnerability"**.

2. **Direct Contact:**
   If GitHub Private Reporting is unavailable, send an email to `brandon@bhubbard.dev` with the subject tag `[SECURITY: unified-audit-rs]`.

### What to Include in Your Report

To help us investigate and patch quickly, please include:
- A clear description of the vulnerability and attack vector.
- Affected version(s) or commit hashes.
- Step-by-step reproduction steps or a minimal Proof of Concept (PoC).
- Potential impact.
